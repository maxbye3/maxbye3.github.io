From the minds behind counter-spy (TM) comes Assassin's Conversation(c).
Are people actually interested in your chat or are they just trying to make you drink?
Basically, it's that university game assassins but for Houseparty.
This a PASSIVE-LITE game. So the assassin can choose to strike whenever they like!
You will be RANDOMLY be assigned one of two tasks:

1). ASSASSIN - Try and get someone to say a keyword.

Assassins are trying to get the other players to say a KEY WORD. For example, "Money plant" or "Tiger King". If the assassin succeeds all of the other players drink. 
The ASSASSIN has won.

If ASSASSIN is caught out, the ASSASSIN must take a GIANT SIP (see index) and loses the game.

2). NORMAL PLAYERS - Try and guess the assassin
Can accuse anyone at anytime of trying to get them to say a keyword. 
The accusation must contain: 
1) The person who they think is the ASSASSIN 
2) The general theme of what they are trying to be forced to say (I will adjudicate).

If correct all the NORMAL PLAYERS win! 
If incorrect the ACCUSSER must drink!
Frequent, incorrect guesses will be punished with GIANT SIP (see index)

Max: To start there will be one ASSASSIN.

I will message you privately which task and (if ASSASSIN) keyword you've been assigned. KEEP IT SECRET!
-------------------
INDEX
Giant Sip - really big sip of drink.
